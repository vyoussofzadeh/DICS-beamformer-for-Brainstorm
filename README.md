# DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm
This is a DICS beamformer implementation for the Brainstorm (BS) software package. The dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) beamformer technique enables the study of cortical sources of oscillatory activation in frequency-domain (Gross et al., 2001). DICS is a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer in the frequency domain. It estimates the covariance matrix to calculate the spatial filter using the sensor-level cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix and applies the filter to the sensor-level CSD to reconstruct the source-level CSDs of pairwise voxel activations, providing coherence measures between the source pairs.

Note that the new pipeline is available at the BS GitHub repository: https://github.com/brainstorm-tools/brainstorm3/blob/master/toolbox/process/functions/process_ft_sourceanalysis_dics.m. The following details are based on the older version of the pipeline.

This implementation has mainly focused on localizing induced activations due to task-MEG responses, e.g., an overt definition naming language experiment.

Before running, follow these steps:

- Add the FieldTrip toolbox to the Matlab path, e.g., ft_path = 'xx/fieldtrip_20190419'; addpath(ft_path); ft_defaults;
- Estimate headmodel: overlapping spheres for surface-based and MRI volume for volumetric-based source mapping;

To run the DICS-BF in BS:

1. Open Brainstorm
2. Add (preprocessed epoched) trial responses to the processing window,<br/>

4. Choose DICS-beamformer as the source modeling approach, and MEG (MEG-MAG, or MEG GRAD) as the sensor type,

5. Pipeline estimates time-frequency responses (sensor-space, average across all sensors), <br/>

6. Select the time interval of post-vs-pre responses, e.g., [-0.3,0;0.7,1.2]
7. Select the frequency of interest, e.g., f=22Hz; A dpss smoothing window of 4Hz is applied (by default, see `vy_fft`, line 656) to estimate the cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix.
8. Results (surface map) are stored in the last trial response.<br/>

# Updates
- 07/08/21, A new tutorial wiki BS page was created: https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/DICS
- 07/08/21, Pipeline is officially added to BS github repository: https://github.com/brainstorm-tools/brainstorm3/blob/master/toolbox/process/functions/process_ft_sourceanalysis_dics.m
- 07/01/21, a new update was made. Script was reformatted to match the standards in Brainstorm.
- 06/06/21, a new version of the pipeline [process_ft_sourceanalysis_dics.m](https://github.com/vyoussofzadeh/DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm/blob/master/process_ft_sourceanalysis_dics.m) was added to the repository. For convenience and compatibility, variable inputs were integrated into a BS option GUI interface. The new version should produce the same results as the old version [process_ft_sourceanalysis_DICS_BF.m](https://github.com/vyoussofzadeh/DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm/blob/master/Older%20version/process_ft_sourceanalysis_DICS_BF.m).
