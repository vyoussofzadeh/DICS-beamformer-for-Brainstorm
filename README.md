# DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm
This is a DICS beamformer implementation for the Brainstorm (BS) software package. The dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) beamformer technique enables the study of cortical sources of oscillatory activation in frequency-domain (Gross et al., 2001). DICS is a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer in the frequency domain. It estimates the covariance matrix to calculate the spatial filter using the sensor-level cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix and applies the filter to the sensor-level CSD to reconstruct the source-level CSDs of pairwise voxel activations, and this provides coherence measures between the source pairs.

This implementation has mainly focused on localizing induced activations due to task-MEG responses, eg, an overt definition naming language experiment.

Before running,
- Add Fieldtrip toolbox to the Matlab path, eg, ft_path = 'xx/fieldtrip_20190419'; addpath(ft_path); ft_defaults;
- Estimate headmodel: overlapping spheres for surface-based and MRI volume for volumetric-based source mapping;
- Estimate noise co-variance form trial responses: pipeline needs these details for initial settings only.

To run the DICS-BF in BS,
1. Copy "process_ft_sourceanalysis_DICS_BF.m" to BS directory, '../brainstorm3/toolbox/process/functions/'
2. Open Brainstorm
3. Add (preprocessed epoched) trial responses to the processing window,<br/>

6. Pipeline estimates time-frequency responses (sensor-space, average across all sensors), <br/>

7. Select the time interval of post-vs-pre responses, eg, [-0.3,0;0.7,1.2]<br/>
8. Select the frequency of interest, eg, f=22Hz; A dpss smoothing window of 4Hz is applied (by default, see vy_fft, line 656) to estimate cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix<br/>
9. Results (surface map) are stored in the last trial response.<br/>

# Notes
- The pipeline by default investigates the desynchrony effects (power suppression effects, active < baseline). You might be interested in synchrony effects (active > baseline). If so, please uncomment lines 374-375 and comment out line 376 to have an option for both analyses. 

# Updates
- On 06/0621, a new version of the pipeline [process_ft_sourceanalysis_dics.m](https://github.com/vyoussofzadeh/DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm/blob/master/ft_sourceanalysis_dics.m) was added to the repository. For convenience and compatibility, variable inputs were integrated into a BS option GUI interface. The [process_ft_sourceanalysis_DICS_BF.m](https://github.com/vyoussofzadeh/DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm/tree/master/Older%20version) should produce the same results as the new version.
